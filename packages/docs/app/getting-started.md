# Welcome to Bounce UI

Bounce UI is a modern, high-performance component library designed to help developers build beautiful, responsive interfaces faster. Built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, Bounce UI combines developer-friendly APIs with production-ready components.

## Why Choose Bounce UI?

Built on the solid foundation of shadcn's accessibility-first approach, Bounce UI extends its capabilities with production-grade enhancements for demanding applications. Unlike prototype-focused libraries, our components undergo rigorous testing with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure enterprise-grade reliability, and include comprehensive accessibility validation through Axe Core to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

We maintain strict TypeScript enforcement throughout the library, providing fully typed components with advanced generics that enable prop validation at build time and deliver intelligent autocompletion in your IDE. This TypeScript-first philosophy extends to our utilities and hooks, all with generated type definitions and strict null checking.

Performance is engineered into every component through multiple optimization strategies. The library features a tree-shakable architecture using ESModules, efficient re-renders with memoization, and lazy-loadable component chunks - resulting in a remarkably lightweight core runtime of approximately 15kb when gzipped. Importantly, Bounce UI maintains zero external dependencies beyond React itself.

For customization, we fully embrace Tailwind CSS's capabilities rather than just supporting basic theming. Developers gain direct access to all Tailwind variants (dark mode, hover states, etc.) through component props, along with CSS variable theming that requires zero runtime. Our components function as Tailwind plugins, enabling visual consistency while preventing style conflicts.

Accessibility is implemented as a core behavior rather than an afterthought. Beyond compliance checklists, we ensure full keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA landmark roles, and thoroughly test screen reader compatibility with VoiceOver and JAWS. Components include intelligent focus management and degradation strategies to maintain usability in diverse environments.

Finally, Bounce UI is optimized for modern React ecosystems with first-class support for Next.js App Router, React Server Components, and streaming SSR. Components include built-in Suspense boundaries and are designed to work seamlessly within server-rendered contexts without hydration mismatches.
